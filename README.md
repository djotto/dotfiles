# djotto's dotfiles

Initially based on [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), customized and converted to
[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), with some bits nicked from
[nhs-england-tools/dotfiles](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles/) and other places I forget. I even wrote
the odd script myself.

Mac-only right now. Do not attempt to use as-is (at best it will make your machine weird). Do not attempt to fork (I
rebase this project). Steal bits instead.
